This meant information about the beginning of the sequence got \"lost\" by the time the model reached the end.  This is called the \"vanishing gradient problem.\"\n\n2.  **Attention's Solution:**  Attention mechanisms allow the model to directly access *all* parts of the input sequence when processing each element.
